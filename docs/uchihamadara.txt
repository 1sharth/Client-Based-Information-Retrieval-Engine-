Kabuto takes control over MÅ«'s body and explains to Madara that he has made him stronger than when he was in his prime. With that, Madara pushes forward and takes down a large portion of the Fourth Division using only taijutsu and kenjutsu to dominate them, with the aid of his Sharingan to evade their attacks. Temari tells Naruto to enter "that mode", but he replies that he is out of chakra and cannot do so. She later hits Madara with an attack that sends him away, but little to no damage is done. He then uses a powerful flame technique on the alliance, who barely manage to counter it with their combined water techniques. Madara then launches plenty of fireballs at the alliance and also reappears in the smoke to fight. As he proceeds to defeat even more of them, he is stopped by Gaara's sand. Gaara, onoki and Naruto manage to corner Madara with their techniques. However, Madara activates his Susanoo to shield himself from Naruto's Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan. Naruto enters Sage Mode and after Gaara takes Madara away from the Susanoo, Naruto attacks him with a Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. However, he activates his Rinnegan and absorbs Naruto's attack, confirming Kabuto's hypothesis on the Sharingan's potential to evolve into the Rinnegan. Madara drops a meteorite on the Fourth Division, but while onoki stops it, he is unable to stop the second meteorite. It falls on them, crushing and killing a large number of them. There are few survivors, but they are wounded, including onoki. Madara then attempts to summon the Nine-Tails but fails because it is still sealed within Naruto. He then proceeds to test Hashirama's cells inside of him by using the Wood Release Secret Technique: Nativity of a World of Trees, leaving Naruto and the other surviving shinobi of the Fourth Division in shock.
